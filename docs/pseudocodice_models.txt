FUNCTION train_tree_model(x_train, y_train):
    trains the Decision Tree on the training data
    with sklearn library with max_depth = 5 to avoid overfitting

    RETURN the Decision Tree

FUNCTION train_knn_model(x_train, y_train):
    trains the K-NN on the training data with sklearn library

FUNCTION preprocess_data_mushrooms()
    transform the class column with LabelEncoder //valori 0 e 1 per commestibile e velenoso
    remove veil-type and stalk-root columns due to poor impact
    convert the attributes with one-hot-encoding and scale the information
    
    RETURN attributes and classes

FUNCTION preprocess_data_rice()
    convert the input data into utf-8 strings
    transform the class colum with LabelEncoder
    scale the features

FUNCTION plot_feature_importance(model, feature_names, title, filename, x_data, y_data, top_n)
    IF the model is a Decision Tree or a Random Forest
        gets the model's feature importance
    ELSE IF the model is K-NN
        calcolates the model's permutation_importance and it's mean
    
    sort the features in descending order based on importance, create the bar graph and save
    it in a .png file

FUNCTION main()
    The main enables the user to choose one of the datasets to train and test the models,
    then calls all the functions and prints all the results and statistics
